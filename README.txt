This was a personal project designed as a travel blog for my friends and family to read as I travel to and from NZ. In addition to a front end design, I developed a fully functioning content management system where I can easily upload videos, blog posts, and photos for my family to view. This blog was not meant for public use, so each user has their own secure account which must be approved before they can access all content. I have also implemented a subscription option so that users can receive instant email notifications when a new post is published.
